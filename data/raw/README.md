## Data Source

This project uses data derived from the PIC (Pediatric Intensive Care) database.

Due to patient privacy, ethical constraints, and data use agreements,
raw data is not included in this repository.

Access to the PIC database requires appropriate authorization and compliance
with institutional and regulatory guidelines.

### Data Usage
The analysis focuses on structured clinical features relevant to
pneumonia prediction and outcome modeling.

Researchers may reproduce this work by obtaining access to the PIC database
and following the preprocessing steps outlined in the notebooks.
