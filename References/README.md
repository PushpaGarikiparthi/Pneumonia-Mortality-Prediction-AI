# Pneumonia Prediction AI

This repository contains a **baseline machine learning / deep learning pipeline**
for pneumonia prediction, developed for research and experimentation purposes.

⚠️ This project is **not a clinical diagnostic system** and is intended solely
for academic and learning use.

## Problem Statement
Pneumonia is a respiratory condition that can be identified using patient data
and/or medical imaging. The goal of this project is to explore a baseline
prediction approach and establish a reproducible ML pipeline.

---

## Project Scope
- Build a baseline prediction model for pneumonia
- Focus on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Emphasize reproducibility and experimentation
